# WiFi Packet Capture and Analysis

## Overview

This project involves capturing WiFi packets in a real-world environment and analyzing them to gain insights into network traffic. Through the use of tools like WireShark and understanding WiFi standards, students will explore device identification, encryption, and packet types.

## Objectives

- Capture WiFi packets in a chosen environment for 1-2 hours.
- Identify MAC addresses of WiFi devices.
- Determine encryption status.
- Analyze packet types and identify devices using RTS/CTS.

## Tools Required

- WireShark (Linux preferred, but Windows or Mac OS can be used)
  - [Download WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)

## Instructions

1. **Packet Capture**: Use WireShark to capture WiFi packets in a selected environment.
   
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Identify MAC addresses of WiFi devices.
   - Determine encryption status.
   - Count and classify packet types.
   - Identify devices using RTS/CTS.

3. **Reporting**:
   - Compile findings into a report, answering provided questions.
